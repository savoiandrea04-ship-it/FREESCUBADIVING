            <p className="text-white/70 leading-relaxed">
              A cenote is a natural freshwater sinkhole formed when limestone bedrock collapses, revealing an underground system of caves and caverns. The result: crystal-clear water, ancient stalactite and stalagmite formations, mesmerizing haloclines, and sunbeams piercing the water like laser light. It's a diving experience completely unlike anything the open ocean can offer — and it's exclusive to this corner of the world.
